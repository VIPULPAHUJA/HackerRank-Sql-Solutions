Question - 1 You are given two sets.
Set A = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
Set B = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

How many elements are present in A U B ?

Solution - A U B = n(A) + n(B) -n(A∩B) = 6 + 7 -5 = 8

Question - 2 You are given two sets.
Set A = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
Set B = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

How many elements are present in A∩B ?

Solution - Number of Common elements =  5

Question - 3 You are given two sets.
Set A = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
Set B = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

How many elements are present in A - B ?
Solution - A - B = A - A∩B = 6 - 5 = 1

Question - 4 You are given two sets.
Set A = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
Set B = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

What is the total number of ordered pairs present in the A X B Cartesian Product  ? 
Only enter the correct integer in the answering box. Do not include any extra spaces, tabs or newlines.

Solution A X B = 6 X 7 =42

Nel             2341    F  
What is the count of rows returned in the following relational selection?
σ(Number<3000)(Student)

Only enter a single integer. Do not include any extra spaces or newlines.

Solution - for sigma less than 3000 for "Number" column we have "2" rows,


Question - 6 Consider the following data table named Student.

Name                Number  Sex  
Nina                3412    F 
Mike                1234    M  
Nelson              2341    F  

What is the count of attributes (columns) returned in the following projection?
π(Name, Number)(Student)

Only enter a single integer. Do not include any extra spaces or new

Solution - "2" is count of columns as here attributes numbers are queried not number of rows
